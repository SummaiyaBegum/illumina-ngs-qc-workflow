## FastQC & fastp workflow
# 🧬 Quality Control of Bacterial Whole-Genome Sequencing Data

### 📌 Overview
This repository documents a reproducible quality control (QC) workflow for bacterial whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data using FastQC and fastp. The aim is to assess raw Illumina paired-end sequencing reads, identify sequencing artifacts, apply evidence-based trimming, and validate improvements before downstream analysis.

All analyses were performed using publicly available sequencing data, making this workflow suitable for reproducible learning and demonstration.
